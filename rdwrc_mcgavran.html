          The Donald McGavran archives are primarily housed in two locations. <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc">The Billy Graham Center</a> at Wheaton College in Illinois, which holds papers from his early years. The Latourette Library at William Carey International University in Pasadena, California holds his papers from 1965 until his death in 1990.

          The Pasadena papers are bing processed and increasingly more materials will be made available at this web site. Materials are accessible to researchers who make arrangements to visit the site.

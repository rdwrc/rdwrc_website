THE HIGHEST PRIORITY: CROSS-CULTURAL EVANGELISM
Ralph D. Winter

I am deeply grateful to each of these men who have preceded me and for
the time they have spent reading my paper and responding to it. I cannot
blame them if they did not always understand what I meant. I am sure
what I wrote was not entirely clear. In almost no case am I in any
disagreement with their emphases. Often they have added things which
I would have put in myself had I had more space.  

In particular, may I say how very grateful I am to Pablo Perez and
Philip Hogan for their emphasis upon the spiritual factors, which in many
cases override all others in importance. However, I am sure that they
are not trying to say that the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives does
away with the need for any active intellectual analysis. In the headquarters
of Dr. Hogan's church in Springfield, Missouri, the Holy Spirit has
superintended them in an immense amount of tough thinking and analysis,
or they would not be operating the largest printing establishment in the
state of Missouri, nor would they have been one of the very first of the
mission agencies in the United States to make extensive use of computer
facilities. Quite obviously, there is no conflict, rightly understood,
between the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the need for careful, patient,
analytical thinking.

It is evident that we must not fail to distinguish between what we may
expect God to do and what God may legitimately expect us to do. For
example, I feel sure that God, if he wished to, would be able by his Holy
Spirit to eliminate language differences and merge everyone into a single
congregation. But we must respect the fact that the outpouring of the
Holy Spirit in the New Testament did not eliminate the Greek language,
nor the Greek culture, but in fact allowed an additional Greek-speaking
church tradition where there was only a Jewish church before. There may
have been many Jewish Christians who fervently wished the Greeks would
follow their form of worship, but God apparently had other plans.

Dr. Perez has helpfully stressed the fact that the Gospel changes
human cultures; it does not merely yield to them. He, of course, is speaking
within a culture as an E-1 evangelist. This is the proper attitude. But
if Dr. Perez were to go to a foreign country to a new situation, he would
then be in a different situation, and would have to be very respectful of
the culture and not fight against it as he knows how to do within his own
culture. I, for example, in my own ministry in a foreign situation, had to
learn to respect and not to fight much of the aboriginal culture lest I
myself confuse my culture with the Gospel.

Now in regard to Dr. Loewen‘s paper, one of the misunderstandings
which we discovered only yesterday afternoon is that my use of the phrase
"near-neighbor evangelism" is confined to the E1 sphere, whereas he is
taking it to mean E-1 and H-2. If I were to mean what he meant by the
phrase, then I would come out with the same statements that he has,
which naturally reduces the proposal that "four out of five
non-Christians are beyond the reach of near-neighbor evangelism." I also
appreciate very much the fact that he has underscored the great complexity of
E-3 evangelism. As an anthropologist, he seems almost to say that witnessing
to totally strange people is so difficult that it ought not to be attempted.
I would agree except to add the provision that E—3 evangelism, however
difficult it may he, must be attempted at all costs where there is no
reasonable possibility of effective E-1 and E-2 evangelism, There are, as an
example, hundreds of thousands of Christians in Ethiopia today who would
not know Christ, and who would not have the Bible, had evangelical
Christians from other lands stayed home and simply insisted that the
local Coptic church should do the job. In Ethiopia and in countless other
situations, both in the past and in the future, B-1 and B-2 evangelism is
not a viable option, and in that case the extraordinarily difficult E-3
distance must be traversed by someone who is obedient to that level of
hazard and difficulty which Dr. Loewen so rightly underscores.

For these reasons, therefore, I feel I must applaud the plans being
laid by David Cho and others in Asia for 100 Asian missionaries to go to
that at great island of Kalimantan. This will surely speed up, not hinder,
World evangelization. And. there is still another island, the world's largest
called New Guinea. In the western half alone, indeed in just the
immense swampy southern section of the western half — a swamp so
large that someone said the largest swamp in Florida looks like a phone
booth by comparison - there are 380 tribal languages in which the Gospel
is not yet preached. Only with bold planning and prayerful obedience
will these people soon be reached for Christ, but we cannot expect near-neighbor
evangelism of any type to reach them in this century. If Korean missionaries
can join forces there with the present tiny crew of Western agencies,
this will be a splendid example of East~West partnership in a new modern
era of cross-cultural evangelism.

1 might add that there are other reasons for E—3 contacts being maintained
even after a church is born. One is the need we all have for what
Rene Padilla called "cross-fertilization." E-3 is maximally tough but it
is maximally stimulating. God has not meant for his world family to
persist in cultural ghettos. He has not intended, on the one hand, to merge
the whole family into a single culture. On the other hand, he does not
want ghettos. The body of Christ can be healthy only if there are
separate organs, and the separate organs serve each other. The two-way
flow of E-3 personnel is a most important phenomenon which
must increase not decrease in the life of the world Christian family.

Let me now turn to the many hundreds of responses I have received
from other participants in the Congress. I deeply value and intend in
Save every one of your papers that came to me. Practically all the
questions either concerned the statistical scope of the task or the
theological nature of the task,

Questions about the statistical scope of the task

Let us consider first the scope of the task. Figure 1 is an attempt
to sum it up. Jesus said that no man builds a tower without first
sitting down and calculating the cost: Here at this Congress we must
sit down and assess the task of world evangelization.

Note that the numbers above are all in millions of people in the world
today. You will see I have first divided between those who call themselves
Christians and those who do not call themselves Christians, and you will
see in the column on the far right that the total number of Christians is
1179 million, and the total number of non-Christians is 2723 million.

I want you to think for a moment about this latter number - 2700
million. Do you notice that this is about one million people for each
participant in this Congress? [This means that if each of you all had been
busy and had won a million people on your way here, we would have
been able to disband the Congress!) These two numbers, 1179 and 2723
are, of course, not precise counts except at a certain date - since the
population clock tells us such numbers are constantly changing. For
example, the number of Christians, 1179 million, is increasing by 70,006
each day we are gathered here. If, we had an evangelism clock in addition
to a population clock, it would register the number of additional Christians
each minute for example, from the opening of this Congress until
new, four days later, the number of Christians in the world has grown
more than a quarter or a million. If we had a really sophisticated clock,
we could even record the fact that each day in practically every country
of the world, the percentage of Christians is also increasing. I add these
comments lest anyone shrink from the task of evangelizing the massive
numbers of non—Christians in Figure l. I don‘t want you to wonder if
there is any hope of being successful in world evangelization. Dear brothers
and sisters, we are being successful right now, and we surely have no
statistical reason not to make definite plans here at this Congress to move
ahead with Jesus Christ, Lord of History, to finish the task of world
evangelization.

In other words, the numbers in the last column are only apparently
static. They do not show the fact that we are constantly gaining in the
Christian percentage in all columns, that is, in the Western World, in
Africa, and in Asia. (Australia and Latin America are included in the
Western World; the Pacific I am including in the Asia column.) 

You will now note that both the-Christian and the non-Christian populations
have been further divided. The Christian group is divided into
the committed Christians, who need nurture; and nominal Christians, who
need renewal. Then the non-Christians are also divided in-two groups,
this distinction being the heart of my whole presentation: those who can
be reached by ordinary, near-neighbor evangelism (which I have called
E-l evangelism); and those who are beyond a significant cultural frontier,
whom we can only reach by cross-cultural evangelism, that is, who may
wish to exercise their biblical right to self-determination in establishing a
separate cultural tradition of regular worship and fellowship. In a word,
they are people at a sufficient cultural distance so that we cannot
necessarily expect them to join existing Christian churches. Their existence
calls for special cross-cultural evangelism, and constitutes the major
technical obstacle to world evangelization.

In Figure 2 you see the quantities and distinctions mentioned in Figure 1
now visualized with the spaces drawn to scale. For example, the
four numbers down the right side of the large vertical rectangle - 200,
979, 335, 2387 - are the same numbers we have just seen in the last
column of Figure 1. The first two numbers are those who call themselves
Christians, requiring nurture and renewal. Then you'll notice a dark line
running across the rectangle, and the two categories below this line are
the non-Christians -the 336 million who can he reached by the ordinary
evangelism of Christians reaching out to their cultural near~neighbors,
and 2387 million who are not within the range of the ordinary evangelism
of any Christian congregation — people who require cross cultural
evangelism (E2 or E-3}. Note that according to these estimates, 87 per cent
of the non-Christians are in the cross-cultural category. Before leaving
this diagram, note that most of the people needing renewal are in the
Western World, while the people needing cross-cultural evangelism are
mainly in Asia. This fact helps to account for the instinctive difference
between the way most Western Christians think about evangelism and the
way people involved in cross-cultural evangelism think about evangelism.


Now let's look at Figure 3. Here you see a small triangle representing
the Christian community, from which four arrows emerge. One arrow,
labeled E-0, is aimed into a sector within the Christian community. This
is the winning of nominal Christians to personal faith and commitment -
the "evangelical experience." This E-0 evangelism involves just as much
a spiritual experience as E-1, 13-2, or E-3 evangelism, but there is no
cultural distance involved - hence the zero. The arrow labeled E-1 goes out
of the church into the culture within which the church is at home, the
only barrier being the "stained-glass barrier" between the church and the
world. People in this area, if converted, will feel at home in existing
churches. However, the B-2 arrow reaches outside this culture into a
similar culture that is nevertheless sufficiently different to make the
founding of separate congregations desirable to act as a base for effective
outreach to others in that same culture. The B-3 arrow involves similar
church-planting implications, but reaches out to a totally strange culture
(the circle).

I hope this doesn't seem too complicated. It is a help when looking
at any country or region of the world to size up the situation by making a
rough estimate of the number of people in each of these five categories
which the diagram in Figure 3 gives us: First, there are the committed
Christians (shaded area) who are the only active agents you can count
on to do the work. Next there are the four kinds of people who are not
committed Christians and who are either at a O, 1, 2, or 3 cultural distance
away from the committed Christians. Following this scheme, you can
divide the people in a small town into these five categories. Or you can
make estimates of the number of people in these five categories for a
whole country. This seems to be helpful to size up the task.

I have done this by way of example in the diagrams in Figure 4. The
first three diagrams are for three different sections of the non-Western
world, where from left to right there is a progressively greater number
of committed Christians. (in these diagrams I have not distinguished
between the B-2 and E-3 areas because they are both cross cultural
evangelism and therefore usually require founding new churches.) The fourth
diagram - the Western World - shows the close comparison between
the South Pacific and Western World. In both cases a high proportion
of the people are at least nominal Christians, and this means the need for
cross-cultural evangelism internal to the regions may not seem so important
to people in these areas.

On the other hand, India and Nigeria are more typical of all the rest
of the world, and that is why cross-cultural evangelism is of the highest
priority in the non-Western world. Let me repeat that although there are
a lot of Christians in india, this must not obscure the fact that most of
the people in India are at a cross-cultural distance from any Christian
congregation whatsoever.

In Figure 5 and 6, unlike in the table in Figure 1, we have divided
the total world population first into Western and non-Western spheres.
in Figure 5 you'll notice the statistics from the first column of the
earlier table, where the Western world is divided between Christian and
non-Christian - 965 million Christians and 327 million non-Christians.
Note that the 10,000 missionaries working in the Western world (mainly Europe,
North America, Latin America) are focusing almost all of their efforts
on the nominal Christian sphere while only a fairly small percentage,
according to my estimates, are really concentrating on people who do not
consider themselves Christians (E~1, E~2, and E-3). This is not surprising,
because the majority of Westerners are nominal Christians. Things are
very different in the non-Western world, as we see in Figure 6. There for
simplicity we have divided all the hon-Christians into four groups -
Chinese, Muslim, Hindu and "other." ‘The bottom three layers represent
three virtually untouched blocs of humanity, amounting to 1933 million people.

Let us think prayerfully for a moment about these three groups. A
few minutes ago we noted that there are roughly one million non~Christians
in the world for each participant here. If our Congress participants
consisted of people whose gifts and calling-were focused proportionately
on all non-Christians in the world, would we not have to have here one
participant for each million in each of these groups? This means we would
have to have 502 people here specializing on reaching the 502 million
non-Christian Hindus. These would have to be cross-cultural specialists,
on the whole. We would also have to have 664 people here specializing
on reaching the 664 million Muslims. They too would have to be almost
entirely cross-cultural specialists, since only tiny numbers of Muslims
can be won by local Christians living in their areas who try to reach them
by ordinary evangelism. (Parenthetically, let me observe that the Muslim
group, which is already immense, is growing at a biological rate almost
double that of the Chinese, and that if present rates continue, there will
be more Muslims than Chinese within about ten years. Moving on to
the Chinese, proportionately to represent the 827 million non-Christian
Chinese would require at this Congress 827 people specializing on the
task of reaching them. In the case of the Chinese there are millions of
Christian Chinese to help in the task. But even so, the Chinese are so
split up by dialects, social distinctions, and highly significant clan
differences that most of this task is E-2 rather than E-1, and thus mainly
a cross-cultural problem as with the other two major blocs.

Now note something very significant. As in the case of the Western
world, most of the cross-cultural workers are focusing their efforts on
nurture and E-0 evangelism connected with the Christian community.
The number of Christians in the non—Western world (214 million) is the
sum of the Africa and Asia columns in the previous table, that is 116 + 98.
Again by merging the columns, there are 80 million committed Christians
in the non-Western world, whose nurture soaks up a very large proportion
of the energies of both Christian missionaries and national church
leaders; there are also 134 million nominal Christians who take up practically
all of the rest of the efforts. It is only a guess, but it is safe to say that
95 percent of all missionaries deployed in the non-Western world are
focusing their efforts either on communities that c1aim to be Christian
or upon non-Christian peoples in the immediate environment of the
Christians, these latter probably being mainly the 403 million non-Christians
in the other category in this chart. That leaves only a tiny percentage
of cross-cultural workers to deal with the three major blocs of
non-Western non-Christians. Brothers and sisters, this is a grim picture.
The task to be done on the left is big enough, but precisely where the
cross-cultural task is the largest, the cross~cultural Workers are the fewest.

For example, the number of effective evangelists winning middle caste
and upper case Hindus (well over 400 million people) are very few
indeed, and the number of effective cross-cultural evangelists winning
Muslims are very few indeed. While there may be proportionately more
cross-cultural workers who are reaching out to non-Christian Chinese,
these would mainly be in Taiwan. But even in Taiwan most missionaries
and national leaders are absorbed with the needs of the Christian community.
This is not to begrudge the "inter-church" exchange of E-3 workers.
the danger is that we may easily deceive ourselves concerning the
proportionate weight of personal that is going to the evangelism of non-Christians.
This is so important to understand that we must use an extended illustration
of this whole matter of the statistical scope of the task of
cross-cultural evangelism. Since I have already said a good deal in my original
paper about Pakistan, let me build on that situations.

The rough proportions in Pakistan are similar to the diagram in Figure 4 in India.
In Pakistan there are proportionately fewer Christians than in India,
but they number well over one-half million (out of 70 million).
The Christian community today is the product of a great people movement
and spiritual revival over a half-century ago, but there are very few
people living today who were brought to Christ in that movement, and
the churches of Pakistan by now have a sizable proportion of their own
members who need to be won by E-0 evangelism to personal spiritual
obedience to Christ. The really surprising thing is why the E-1 sphere is
so small. A country of 70 million people where there are 500,000 Christians
does not on the face of it seem likely to be a place where near-neighbor
evangelism would have relatively small significance. Why can't the
500,000 Christians just reach out to their near neighbors and win them to
Christ? This is the crucial question. The answer is that 99 per cent of the
Christians have a Hindu (not Muslim) cultural background, Whereas 97
per cent of the non-Christians in Pakistan are Muslim. In the north you
have scattered communities of Christians (just as in India, most Christians
are in separated, isolated areas, almost like ghettos), but their physical
separation from so many of their countrymen does not remotely approach
the significance of their cultural isolation.

Thus, from the beginning of the revival movement in the north over
fifty years ago until the present time, almost never has a Muslim joined
a Christian church, while hundreds of thousands of former Hindus have
become Christians. Although the church in Pakistan has a large E-0
population of nominal Christians, it is continuing to win some remaining
Hindus to Christ through E-1 evangelism. On this basis, how soon will the
church run out of Hindus to convert? In the northern-part of the country,
where most of the Christians are. practically all of the non-Muslim people
of Pakistan are already at least nominally Christian. Curiously, there are
almost a million people of Hindu background yet to win, but they are in
the South, hundreds of miles from the main body of Christians. While it
would be relatively simple for these Christians to do evangelism in the
South {only a geographical distance away), the Christians are very, very
distant from their Muslim neighbors. Why? Because there is a very
pronounced cultural distance between the cultural tradition represented
by the church and the cultural tradition represented by the Muslims.

Let us be more specific. Both Muslims and the (Hindu-background}
Christians in the North speak Urdu. But they don't speak exactly the same
kind of Urdu. A Muslim can tell either by listening or by reading that the
religious language of the Christians comes from the originally Hindu
minority in his country, and he has monumental prejudices about this
difference. The Christians, on the other hand, while they don't hate the
Muslims, don't feel it is necessary to make a special translation of
the New Testament into the religious language of the Urdu speaking
Muslims, even though there are more than 30 million Urdu speaking
Muslims alone! Feelings of suspicion between the two communities are
so great that an occasional Muslim convert does not feel at home in any
of the Christian congregations. Christians have not yet made an effective
effort nor even drawn up speculative plans for the development of
worshiping communities drawn wholly from the Muslim tradition. This is
only natural, in a way, because the Christians come from a stratum of
society which has for centuries been impoverished and virtually enslaved.
The Christians even yet are barely struggling to their feet economically.
Their resources, their education, their evangelistic imagination does not
readily stretch to radically new ways of evangelizing the Muslims -
especially not to ways that will allow the Muslims the kind of liberty in
Christ which the Gospel guarantees them.

The situation in Pakistan both illustrates the immense scope of the
need for cross-cultural evangelism, and also moves us into the theological
dimension of the problem. To that dimension we must now turn.

Questions about the theological nature of the task

First briefly let me say a word to those who asked, in effect, "Will
not the allowance of indigenous life ways lead. us into syncretism?" Michael
Green has already answered this for us in his excellent discussion of flexibility
without syncretism. I might add a personal note that as a Western Christian,
I grew up without realizing that Easter Sunrise services could easily revert to
their original paganism if Christians attending them do not see and sense
a Christian meaning in them. The very word Easter comes from a Teutonic spring
goddess of fertility called Eastre. The same is true of Christians. We have all
fought to maintain Christ in Christmas, since Christmas is also originally
a pagan holiday taken over by the early church. (Romans gave gifts to each other on
December 25th long before Jesus was born and for that matter, Jesus may have
been born in June, not December.) Briefly, in employing pagan words and customs,
we must be careful to make sure that the whole counsel of God is constantly
taught and understood.

The main theological question, raised more often than any other, is so profound
that I feel I must devote my remaining time to it. The question was stated
in many ways in your response papers, but it is basically this: "Will not
our unit in Christ be destroyed if we follow a concept of cross-cultural
evangelization which is willing to set up separate churches for different
cultural groups within the same geographical area?" It is only humble dependence
upon the Holy Spirit to honor the Word of God above the secular influences
to which we all are subject that I dare to proceed with a perspective which
I myself could not understand nor accept until several years ago. I was brought
up in the United States, where for many people integration is almost like a
civil religion, where such people almost automatically assume that
eventually everyone will speak English and really shouldn't speak any other
language. To me cultural diversity between countries was a nuisance, but
cultural diversity within a country was simply an evil to be overcome. I had
no thought of excluding anyone from any church, (and I still do not), but I
did unconsciously assume that the best thing that could happen to Black, White,
Chicano, etc., was that they all would eventually come to the White,
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant church and learn to be things the way that I 
felt was proper.

Following this kind of America culture-Christianity, many missionaries have
assumed that there ought to be just one national church in a country - 
even if this means none at all for certain sub-groups? Such missionaries,
in all earnestness, have assumed that the denominational pluralism
in their own home country is simply a sin to be avoided. They have
assumed that Southern Baptists aren't necessary in Northern India, even
though, as a matter of fact, in Boston today most of the Anglo
churches have been sitting around waiting for the Arabs and the Japanese
churches, and Portuguese churches, and Greek churches, and Polish churches,
right under the nose of hundreds of good-willed Anglo churches which
have been patiently waiting for these people to assimilate to the Anglo
way of life. With one of two fine exceptions, the Anglo churches, with
all their evangelistic zeal, simply do not have the insight to do this
kind of E-2 and E-3 evangelism.

For my own part, after many years of struggling with this question, I
am now no less concerned than before about the unity and fellowship
of the Christian movement across all ethnic and cultural lines, but I
realize now that Christian unity cannot be healthy if it infringes upon
Christian liberty. In terms of evangelism, we must ask whether the
attempt to extend, for example in Pakistan, an external form into the
Muslim culture is more important than making the Gospel clear to such
peoples within their own culture. Can we not condition our desire for
uniformity by an even greater desire for effective preaching of the Gospel?
I personally have come to believe that unity does not have to require
uniformity, and I believe that there must be such a thing as healthy
diversity in human society and in the Christian world church. I see the world
church as the gathering together of a great symphony orchestra where
we don‘t make every new person coming in play a violin in order to fit
in with the rest. We invite the people to come in to play the same score
- the Word of God - but to play their own instruments, and in this way
there will issue forth a heavenly sound that will grow in the splendor and
glory of God as each new instrument is added.

But some of you have said, "OK, if that is what you mean, what about
the Apostle Paul? Did he set up separate congregations for masters and
slaves?" I really don't know. I don't think so. But that does not mean that
didn't happen. In a recent monograph by Paul Minear entitled The
Obedience of Faith, the author suggests that in Rome there were probably five
separate congregations of Christians, who numbered 21 total 3000, and
that Paul's letter to the Romans was written actually to a cluster of
churches in the city of Rome. He also suggests that these churches were
very different from each other, some being composed almost entirely of
Jewish Christians, and others (the majority) almost entirely of Gentile
Christians. "Instead of visualizing a single Christian congregation,
therefore, we should constantly reckon with the probability that within the
urban area were to be found forms of Christian community which were
as diverse, and probably also as alien, as the churches of Galatia and those
of Judea." But whatever the case in Rome, Paul in his travels was usually
dealing with the phenomenon of house churches, where whole
households, masters and slaves, quite likely worshiped together. We cannot
believe he ever separated people. However, we do know that he was will-
ing to adopt in different places a radically different approach, as he put
it, "for those under the law and for those not under the law." When, for
example, he established an apparently non-Jewish congregation among
the Galatians, it was obviously different, perhaps radically different from
that of the Jewish congregations elsewhere. We know this because Jewish
Christians followed Paul to the Galatians and tried to make them conform
to the Jewish Christian pattern. Galatia is a clear case where it was
impossible for Paul to submit simultaneously both to the provisions of the
Jewish Christian way of life and at the same time to the patterns of a
evidently Greek (or perhaps Celtic) congregation.

Paul's letter to the Galatians, furthermore, shows us how determined
he was to allow the Galatian Christians to follow a different Christian
lifestyle. Thus while we do not have any record of his forcing people to
meet separately, we do encounter all of Paul's holy boldness set in
opposition to anyone who would try to preserve a single normative pattern
of Christian life through a cultural imperialism that would prevent
people from employing their own language and culture as a vehicle for
worship and witness. Here, then, is a clear case of a man with cross-cultural
evangelistic perspective doing everything within his power to guarantee
liberty in Christ to converts who were different from his own social
background.

This same thing is seen when Paul opposed Peter in Antioch. Peter
was a Galilean law who was perhaps to some extent bi-cultural. He could
have at least been able to understand the predominantly Greek lifestyle
of the Antioch church. Indeed, he did seem to fit in until the moment
other Jewish Christians came to the door. At this point Peter also
discovered that in a given situation he had to choose between following Jewish
or Greek customs. At this point he wavered. Did he lack the Spirit of
God? Did he lack the love of God? Or did he fail to understand the way of
God's love? Peter did not question the validity of a Greek congregation.
Peter had already acknowledged. this before his Jewish compatriots
walked in the door. The point was that Peter was pained for others to
know him as one who could shift from one community to the other. What
this means to us today is quite clear. There were in fact in the New
Testament period two significantly different communities of believers.
Peter was regarded the apostle to the circumcision and Paul to the
uncircumcision. Peter identified more easily with the Jews, and no doubt had a
hard time explaining to Jews his experience at Cornelius' household,
namely his discovery that Greek congregations were t.o be considered
legitimate. Paul, on the other hand, was able to identify more closely with
the Greek congregations. They were perhaps eventually his primary
missionary target, even though in a given locality he always began with
the Jews.

One clue for today is the fact that where Paul found some Christians to
be over scrupulous about certain foods, he counseled people in those
situations to abide by the stricter sensibilities of the majority. However,
it is always difficult to make exact parallels to a modern situation. The
New Testament situation would compare more easily to modern India
today were it the case that the only Christians in India were Brahmins
(and other members of the middle castes) with their highly restrictive
diet. Then we would envision Brahmin Christians finding it hard to allow
the less restrictive meat-eating groups to become Christian; but the actual
situation is very nearly the reverse. In India today it is those who eat
meat who are Christians, and the problem is how to apply Paul's
missionary strategy to this situation. In regard to food restrictions, it is as though
the Brahmins are "under the law," not the present Christians. In this
situation can we imagine Paul saying, "To those under the law I will go
as under the law if by all means I may win some"? Can we hear him say as
an E-2 or E-3 evangelist, "If meat makes my brother offended, I will eat no
meat"? Can we hear him defending worshiping groups among the Brahmins
against the suggestion or expectation. that they should change their
diet or join congregations of very different lifestyle in order to be
accepted as Christians? Against the accusation that he was dividing the church
of Christ, can we hear Paul insist that "in Christ there is neither Jew nor
Greek, low caste or high caste"? Is this not the actual force of his
oft-repeated statement that these different "kinds of people following their
different cultural patterns, are all equally acceptable to God? Was he
really announcing a policy of local integration, or was he insisting on
the equality of diversity?

Note very carefully that this perspective does not enforce (nor even allow)
a policy of segregation, nor any kind of ranking of Christians in first and
second class categories. it rather guarantees equal acceptability of
different traditions. It is clear-cut apostolic policy against forcing
Christians of one life-style to be proselytized to the cultural patterns of
another. This is not a peripheral matter in the New Testament.
True circumcision is of the heart. True baptism is of the heart. It is a matter
of faith, not works, or customs, or rites. In Christ there is freedom and
liberty in this regard - people must be free either to retain or abandon their
native language and life-style. Paul would not allow anyone to glory either
in circumcision or in uncircumcision. he was absolutely impartial.
He was also widely misunderstood. Paul's problem ultimately was in gaining
acceptance by the Jews, and it was Asian Jews, possible Christians,
who pointed him out in the temple and thus finally caused his martyrdom for
his belief in the separate liberty of the Greek Christian traditions. Let no
one who seeks to be a missionary in the tradition of the Apostle Paul expect
that working between two cultures will be easy to do. But he can take heart
in the fact that the hazards of the profession are more than justified
by the urgent missionary purposes of the cross-cultural evangelist.

If, for example, a cross-cultural evangelist encourages members of a
Brahmin family to begin worship services in their own home, does he
insist that they invite people from across town to their very first meeting?
On the other hand, any Brahmin who becomes a Christian and who begins
to understand the Bible will soon realize, whether it was entirely
clear before or not, that he now belongs to a world family within which
there are many tribes and tongues - indeed, according to the Book of Revelation
(Rev. 7:9), this kind of diversity will continue right down to the end of time.
When cross-cultural evangelist allows the development of a Brahmin
congregation, he is not thereby proposing Brahmin segregation from the
world church. he is merely affirming their liberty in Christ to retain
those elements of their life-style that are not inimical to the Gospel of
Christ. he is not increasing their alienation. He is giving them the Word
of God which is the passkey to the ultimate elimination of all manner
of prejudices, and is already signing them into a world Christian family
which embraces all peoples, tribes and tongues as equals.

Now, I regret that this subject is so delicate, and I would not embark
upon it if it were not so urgently significant for practical evangelistic
strategies which we must have if we are going to win the world for Christ.
I would even bring it up. Yet I must say I believe this issue is the most
important single issue in evangelism today.

Many people asked me what I meant by strategic value of the
establishment of youth churches. It is important to realize the youth
situation is highly parallel to the situation we have just discussed, It is by
no means a case where we are suggesting that young people not be allowed
in adult services. We are not suggesting segregation of the youth. Youth
churches are not ends, but means. We are not abandoning the thought
that young people and older people should often be in the same service
together. We are merely insisting, with what I pray is apostolic intuition,
that young people have the freedom in Christ to meet together by themselves
if they choose to, and especially if this allows them to attract other
young people who would likely not come to Christ in an age-integrated
service.

I will, however, freely admit that this strategy may unintentionally
make it appear that we are setting aside goals of unity for goals of evangelism.
This in fact is not the case. It is quite the opposite: we are willing to
do evangelism in the highly divided world in which we live, believing
wholeheartedly that in the long run the working of the Holy Spirit through
true evangelism is the only way to melt down the high walls of prejudice
and thus produce unity where none at all existed before.

Some have warned that this kind of culturally sensitive evangelism
will lead to ghetto churches. I suggest rather that it will go to ghetto
situations and eventually bring those isolated people into contact with others
in a rewarding and enriching way. Where there are already ghetto churches
all around the world that are isolated from their neighbors, this may not
be the fault of the original evangelists, but of the nurture in succeeding
years. if the Gospel begins in a ghetto, it should not end there. Rival
street gangs may more easily be brought together by being brought to
Christ separately. The initial evangelist does not add a ghetto to the
church; he takes the church to the ghetto. People from that ghetto are
then automatically present at the next city-wide Christian meeting. The
efforts of the Billy Graham Crusades must be seen in this light not as an
optional, but as an essential, beautiful, and permanent part of God‘s
ultimate uniting strategy. There must, in fact, be annual city-wide and
regional Christian festivals whether or not Billy Graham can personally
be there. There must be many other contacts between Christians of all
kinds between such annual meetings. Yet we must yield to the fact that
God allows the family and the local congregation and even whole denominations
to speak different languages and to express their faith in different
linguistic and cultural traditions. But woe to such self-determining Christians
if this liberty in Christ becomes understood as a basis for superiority
or isolation. Why? Because, as Paul said, "In Christ there is neither Greek.
nor Jew, nor Barbarian, nor Scythian, nor bond nor free, nor male nor
female."

It is a curious fact that the kind of culturally sensitive evangelism I
have been talking about has always been acceptable wherever people are
geographically isolated. No minds if Japanese Christians gather by
themselves in Tokyo, or Spanish-speaking Christians gather by themselves
in Mexico, or Chinese-speaking Christians gather by themselves
in Hong Kong. But there is considerable confusion in many people's
minds as to whether Japanese, Spanish and Chinese Christians should be
allowed or encouraged to gather by themselves in Los Angeles. Very
specifically, is it good evangelistic strategy to found separate
congregations in Los Angeles in order to attract such people?
Do Cantonese speaking non-Christians need a Cantonese-speaking congregation
to attract them to a Christian faith and fellowship? if you talk to different
people, you Will get different answers. In my opinion, this question about
evangelistic strategy in forming of separate congregations must be considered
as an area of Christian liberty, and is to be decided purely on
the basis of whether or not it allows the Gospel to be presented effectively
to more people - that is, whether it is evangelistically strategic.
Some go as far as granting separate language congregations, but hesitate
differences between people are social and non-linguistic. Somehow they
feel that people may be excused for meeting separately if their language
is different, but that the Gospel urges us to ignore all other cultural
differences. Many people are literally outraged at the thought that a local
congregation would deliberately seek to attack people of a certain social
level. And yet, whole no one should be excluded from any church under
any circumstances, it is a fact that where people can choose their church
associations voluntarily, they tend to sort themselves out according to
their own way of life pretty consistently. But this absolutely must be their
own free choice. We are never suggesting an enforced segregation. Granting
that we have this rick diversity, let us foster unity and fellowship
being that we have this rich diversity, let us foster unity and fellowship
between congregations just as we now do between families rather than to
teach everyone to worship like Anglo-Americans. Let us glory in the fact
that the world Christian family now already includes representatives of
more different languages and cultures than any other organization or
movement in human history. Let us never be content with mere isolation, but
let us be cautious about hastening to uniformity. If the whole world church
could be gathered into a single congregation, Sunday after Sunday, there would
eventually and inevitably be a loss of a great deal of rich diversity of the
present Christian traditions. Does God want this? Do we want this?

Jesus died for those people around the world. He did not die to preserve our
Western way of life. He did not die to make Brahmins eat meat. Can't you hear
Paul the Evangelist saying we must go to these people within the systems in
which they operate? True, this is the cry of a cross-cultural evangelist,
not a pastor. We can't make every local church fit this pattern of every other
local church. But we must have radically new efforts of cross-cultural
evangelism in order to effectively witness to 2387 million people,
and we cannot believe that we can continue to ignore this highest priority.
